<div align="center">
    <h4>
        A Pygame-based simulation modeling vehicle movement and traffic light control at a 4-way intersection. 
        It features a timer system for traffic signals and supports various vehicle types such as cars, buses, 
        and trucks. The project can serve as a base for AI/ML traffic optimization or data analysis.
